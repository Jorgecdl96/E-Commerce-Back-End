## Installation

The Package json is already added in this project, so you should only have to install it in your terminal typing the following 'npm i'.

## Usage

1. Go to ./Develop/db/schema.sql and open a new Terminal.

2. Next, we open the MySQL Shell that connects the terminal to the MySQL instance. In the terminal, at the root directory of the project, enter the following command:

    ```sh
    mysql -u root -p
    ```

3. This command tells the MySQL Shell that we want to log in with the root user (-u). The -p stands for "password.". Once we enter this command, we are prompted to enter the password we created when we installed `MySQL`.

4. We can also execute a file that contains a list of commands using `source`

    ```sh
    source schema.sql
    ```
5. Go to ./seeds/index.js  and open a new Terminal and then run 'npm run seed' to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.

6. Finally, we go to server.js and open a new Terminal and then run the server with 'node server.js' to interact with the routes and database created.
